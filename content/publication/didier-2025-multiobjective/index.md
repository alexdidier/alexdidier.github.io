abstract: "We present an optimisation-based approach to ensure robust asymptotic stability stability of a desired set in the state space of nonlinear dynamical systems, while optimising a general control objective. The approach relies on the decrease of a robust predictive control barrier function (PCBF), which is defined as the optimal value function of a slack minimisation problem with respect to the target set. We show continuity of the proposed robust PCBF, allowing the introduction of a decrease constraint in the control objective minimisation. The PCBF decrease is given with respect to a warmstart value based on a feasible solution at the prior time step. Thereby, the control objective can be optimised while ensuring robust asymptotic stability of the target set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation on a linear space rendezvous and nonlinear lane changing problem."
