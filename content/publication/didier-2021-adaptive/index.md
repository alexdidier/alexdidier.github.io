abstract: 'We propose an adaptive Model Predictive Safety Certification (MPSC) scheme for learning-based control of linear systems with bounded disturbances and uncertain parameters with known bounds. An MPSC is a modular framework, which can be used in combination with any learning-based controller to ensure state and input constraint satisfaction of a dynamical system by solving an online optimisation problem. By continuously connecting the current system state with a safe terminal set using a robust tube, safety can be ensured. Thereby, the main sources of conservative safety interventions are model uncertainties and short planning horizons. We develop an adaptive mechanism to improve the system model, which leverages set-membership estimation to guarantee recursively feasible and non-decreasing safety performance improvements. In order to accommodate short prediction horizons, iterative safe set enlargements using previously computed robust backup plans are proposed. Finally, we illustrate the increase of the safety performance through the parameter and safe set adaptation for numerical examples with up to 16 state dimensions.'
